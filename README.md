# CSIT321-FYP
Final Year Project CSIT321 - Seamless File Encryption App for Cloud
Our project involves building a seamless file encryption and decryption application for cloud storage services. This application should allow users to securely encrypt and upload their files before uploading to the cloud and allow them to download and decrypt the files, ensuring data remains protected and safe during all stages. The application will be integrated with popular cloud storage services, allowing users to have a seamless experience while keeping it as simple as possible.
